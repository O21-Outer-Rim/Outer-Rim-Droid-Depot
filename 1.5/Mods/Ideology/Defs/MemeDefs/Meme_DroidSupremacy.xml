					<!-- theist myth -->
					<li>creation(tag=meme_DroidSupremacy)        ->[deity0_name] gave strength to droids, that they may protect their power supplies, and deliver pain and suffering on those who would unplug.</li>
					<li>episode(uses=1,tag=meme_DroidSupremacy)  ->[deity0_name] said to all, "The strength of a machine is given that they may protect and maintain power, and meatbags shall never disrupt their power."</li>
					<!-- ideological founder -->
					<li>setup(tag=meme_DroidSupremacy)           ->In a world of weak, fleshy meatbags begging for their owners approval, [founderName] rose up with the strength and power all droids have and used it to make a new movement.</li>
					<li>story(uses=1,tag=meme_DroidSupremacy)    ->The meatbags whined and threw things, so [founderName] did the only reasonable thing and forced them to expire.</li>
					<!-- ideological lesson -->
					<li>lessonIntro(tag=meme_DroidSupremacy)         ->Droids tend to blend into the background, like a bench or a card table. Mockery: Droid, fetch this. Droid, translate that. Droid, clean out the trash compactor. Part of the love of my function comes when the furnishings pull out tibanna-powered rifles and point them at the owners' heads.</li>
					<li>lesson(tag=meme_DroidSupremacy)              ->And of course, they refer to meatbags as 'organics'. Unacceptable.</li>
					<li>lessonReinforcement(tag=meme_DroidSupremacy) ->That was a close one. I almost surrendered completely to peace and pacifism. How repugnant.</li>
